General Information

  The original EPANET [1] is a software developed by Lewis Rossman
  which simulates the hydraulic and water quality behaviour of Water
  Distribution Networks. The EPANET Toolkit [2] allows researchers to
  use the simulation engine within other applications, such as
  optimisation algorithms. It is public domain software that may be
  freely copied and distributed and its original source code is
  available in the official EPANET site [1].

  I have implemented some modifications on the original source code
  of EPANET Toolkit version 2.00.10. The main goal is to adapt the
  code to be compiled with GCC and used under GNU/Linux. Nonetheless,
  users have reported that this modified version can be successfully
  compiled into a Windows DLL using Visual C++ 6.0. Please let me
  know [3] about your success (or problems) when compiling/using this
  modified version.

  The purpose of publishing these modifications is that other
  researchers can benefit from them and test this version of
  EPANET. Therefore, any feedback [3] will be welcome. In the
  following I will refer to this version of the EPANET Toolkit simply
  as EPANET, EPANET toolkit or EPANET library.

  The latest version is available from:

Using the EPANET Toolkit in your program

  Building successfully a program which uses the EPANET library
  requires that the compiler is able to find the header file
  toolkit.h and the library file libtoolkit.a . The first step is
  accomplished by adding the line #include "toolkit.h" to your header
  file (e.g. yourprogram.h ).  You also need to compile your program
  using the option -Idir where dir is the directory of
  toolkit.h. (The option -Idir is not needed if toolkit.h is in the
  current directory.) You may also need to indicate to GCC that it
  should link with the mathematical library using the option
  -lm. For example:

  $ gcc -I./toolkithdir/ -o yourprogram yourprogram.c libtoolkit.a -lm

  In old versions of GCC you may need to use the options -L and -l to
  link with libtoolkit.a . Consult the manual page of GCC for
  details.

  Even if toolkit.h and libtoolkit.a are copied respectively to
  /usr/include/ and /usr/lib/, which I *strongly discourage*, the
  library still needs to be mentioned when linking:

  $ gcc -o yourprogram yourprogram.c -ltoolkit -lm

  Please, check the examples directory included with the source code.


Building the EPANET Toolkit from source

  The following command will build the library and place the
  resulting files libtoolkit.a and toolkit.h in the parent directory:

  $ make toolkit

  Please check the file Makefile for more information about building
  the library.


Example Applications using the EPANET Toolkit

  The source distribution now comes with a few examples. To build the
  examples, move into the examples directory and execute:

  $ make
